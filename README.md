Key Design Patterns

MVVM: Reactive UI with ViewModel and StateFlow
Repository Pattern: Data access abstraction
Dependency Injection: Modular and testable architecture
Observer Pattern: Reactive programming with Kotlin Flows
Use Case Pattern: Encapsulated business logic

🛠️ Technology Stack
Core Technologies

Kotlin - Modern, concise, null-safe programming
Jetpack Compose - Declarative UI framework
Coroutines & Flow - Asynchronous programming
Dagger Hilt - Compile-time dependency injection
Navigation Compose - Type-safe navigation

Networking & Data

Retrofit - Type-safe HTTP client
OkHttp - HTTP client with interceptors
Gson - JSON serialization/deserialization
CoinPaprika API - Real-time cryptocurrency data

UI & Design

Material 3 - Latest Material Design system
Compose UI - Modern declarative UI toolkit
Custom Themes - Dark/Light theme support
Responsive Design - Adaptive layouts

🧪 Testing Strategy
Comprehensive Test Coverage
This project demonstrates industry-standard testing practices that employers value:
📝 Unit Tests

ViewModel Testing: MockK with coroutine test utilities
Use Case Testing: Business logic validation with mocked dependencies
Repository Testing: Data layer testing with fake implementations

kotlin@Test
fun `getCoins updates state with list of coins`() = runTest {
    // Given
    val mockCoins = listOf(/* test data */)
    coEvery { getCoinsUseCase() } returns flow { emit(Resource.Success(mockCoins)) }
    
    // When
    advanceUntilIdle()
    
    // Then
    assert(viewModel.state.value.coins == mockCoins)
}
🔗 Integration Tests

Feature Testing: End-to-end feature workflows
Repository Integration: Real ViewModels with fake repositories
Navigation Testing: Screen transitions and data flow

🎯 End-to-End Tests

Complete User Journeys: List → Detail navigation
UI Automation: Compose testing framework
Mock Server Setup: Reliable testing environment

kotlin@Test
fun complete_app_navigation_flow() {
    // Verify list screen loads
    composeRule.onNodeWithText("Bitcoin").assertIsDisplayed()
    
    // Navigate to detail
    composeRule.onNodeWithText("Bitcoin").performClick()
    
    // Verify detail screen content
    composeRule.onNodeWithText("cryptocurrency").assertExists()
}
Test Infrastructure

Custom Test Runners: Hilt testing modules
MockWebServer: API testing infrastructure
Fake Repositories: Isolated testing environments
Coroutine Testing: Proper async testing patterns
